Welcome Mike Green,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
    - For dynamic, front-end interaction on HTML forms.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation and initialise MaterializeCSS components.

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/about/)    
    - Programming language used to interact with a MongoDB database
    - Password security via [werkzeug WSGI library](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/utils/#module-werkzeug.security)
    - [PyMongo library](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) used to link Python with MongoDB Atlas.

- [Flask Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
    - A python framework that uses **[JINJA](https://www.fullstackpython.com/jinja2.html)** template engine.
    - Trying out the **[login import](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#how-it-works)**.

- [Materialize Framework](https://materializecss.com/)
    - A front-end, responsive design framework with a unified 'look and feel'.
    - Using a [date picker](https://materializecss.com/pickers.html)

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
    -  Global cloud database service.


## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
